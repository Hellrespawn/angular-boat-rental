This project was originally created for the "Project UML"-course of the Associate Degree in Software Development at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. It was created together with Hans den Otter en Kees van Ruler, with some code adapted from examples provided by our teacher Paul Jansen.

I have stripped most of their code out of the project and reimplemented it myself, but it is possible (and, indeed, likely) that some small remnants of their code or code style remain. For this reason, this project is published for reference only. There is no license and all rights are reserved.
